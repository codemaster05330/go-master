# Kothak

Kothak is a repository design project for Go.

> Please fell free to critize my ideas and writings. I am using this repo to validate my ideas and learn how to write technical topics.

The aim of the project is to design an Industrial Go Application

What it means by Industrial Go Application or Go for Industrial Programming by [Peter Bourgon](https://peter.bourgon.org/go-for-industrial-programming/):

```
That’s what I’ve tried to do with the title of the talk. I’m speaking today about programming in an industrial context. By that I mean

- in a startup or corporate environment;
- within a team where engineers come and go;
- on code that outlives any single engineer; and
- serving highly mutable business requirements.
```
